CreateSpatialPCAObject(
  counts,
  location,
  covariate = NULL,
  project = "SpatialPCA",
  gene.type = "spatial",
  sparkversion = "spark",

}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Gene expression count matrix (matrix), the dimension is m x n, where m is the number of genes and n is the number of locations.}

\item{location}{Spatial location matrix (matrix), the dimension is n x d, n is the number of locations, d is dimensin of spatial coordinates, e.g. d=2 for locations on 2D space. The rownames of locations and the colnames of count matrix should be matched.}

\item{covariate}{The covariates in experiments (matrix, if any covariate included), n x q, n is the number of locations, q is the number of covariates. The rownames of covariates and the rownames of locations should be matched.}

\item{project}{Name of the project (for record keeping).}

\item{gene.type}{The type of genes to be used: "spatial" for spatially expressed genes; "hvg" for highly variable genes; "custom" for user specified genes, default is "spatial".}

\item{sparkversion}{In spatial gene selection, specify "spark" for small sample size data for higher detection power of spatial genes, "sparkx" for large sample size data for saving time and memory.}

\item{numCores_spark}{If gene.type="spatial", specify the number of CPU cores in SPARK package to use when selecting spatial genes.}

\item{gene.number}{The number of top highly variable genes if gene.selection=="hvg" (use all HVG genes if this number is not specified);
number of top spatially expressed genes if gene.selection=="spatial" (use all significant spatially expressed genes if this number is not specified).}

\item{customGenelist}{A list of user specified genes if  gene.type=="custom".}

\item{min.loctions}{The features (genes) detected in at least min.loctions number of loctions, default is 20.}

\item{min.features}{The locations where at least min.features number of features (genes) are detected, default is 20.}
}
\value{
Returns SpatialPCA object, with filtered and normalized gene expression matrix and corresponding location matrix.
