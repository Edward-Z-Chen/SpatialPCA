\title{Obtain NMF low dimensional components for dimension reduction methods comparison.}
\usage{
get_NMF(count, PCnum)
}
\arguments{
\item{count}{Count expression g by n matrix. g is gene number, n is sample size.}

\item{PCnum}{Number of PCs.}
}
\value{
A d by n matrix of low dimensional components from NMF. d is number of low dimensional components, which is same as number of Spatial PCs in SpatialPCA. n is sample size.
